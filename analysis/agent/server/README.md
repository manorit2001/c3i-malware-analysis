# Real time agent server

## Intro
The agent server is the part which will handle the requests generated by the client in the monitoring engine. 

It will automatically 
- parse-dumps and extract IOCs
- perform static-analysis on the suspicious files
- send data to the mapping

## Usage
- Install all requirements present in the directory
- Setup `config.ini` in the directory ( `config.dist.ini` is given as an example )
```
[default]
analysis_script_path = <path to analysis script>
mapping_script_path = <path to mapping script>
public_ip = <public ip of server>
```

### analysis_script_path
This is the full path to analysis.py script present in the system, 
It is internally called using `subprocess` and hence, you should have `requirements-analysis.txt` installed for it to work properly

### mapping_script_path
This is the full path to mapping.py script present in the system, 
It is internally called using `subprocess` similar to `analysis.py` and hence, you should have `requirements-mapping.txt` installed for it to work properly

### public_ip
The analysis engine should have kibana port exposed so that the users present in the monitoring can see the outputs generated in the mapping part. 
The public ip is used to give the user URL to visit after everything is done. It will be returned as `http://{public_ip}:5601` 

**note 5601 port should be exposed**
