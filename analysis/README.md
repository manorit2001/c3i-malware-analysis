# Analysis
This module focuses on generating useful information from the dumps

## Dependencies
- `exiftool`
- `wireshark-cli` ( `tshark` )

## Usage
Create a `logs` directory relative to `analysis.py` and keep all the logs generated from `monitoring.exe` in that file

After that, you can use `analysis.py` which will generate all the outputs in `outputs` folder which you can later have a look for the informations which are extracted

These informations can be later used to train the ML model for classifying the system behaviour
