# Analysis
This module focuses on generating useful information from the dumps

## Dependencies
- `exiftool`
- `wireshark-cli` ( `tshark` )
- `clamav` ( `clamscan` )

## Setting up extra dependencies
Create a `deps` folder relative to `analysis.py`
Make 3 folders

### peid

- [signature_long.txt](https://URLHERE)
- [signature_short.txt](https://URLHERE)

### rules 
- This directory is just a simple ([git-clone](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules))

### signature
- [main.cvd](https://database.clamav.net/main.cvd)
- [daily.cvd](https://database.clamav.net/daily.cvd)

## Usage
Create a `logs` directory relative to `analysis.py` and keep all the logs generated from `monitoring.exe` in that file

After that, you can use `analysis.py` which will generate all the outputs in `outputs` folder which you can later have a look for the informations which are extracted

These informations can be later used to train the ML model for classifying the system behaviour
