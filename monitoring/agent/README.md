# Real time agent

This agent is a 24x7 agent with capabilities of analysing a specific malware sample also

It contains 2 parts

- server
- client

## server
The server should be present where the analysis will occur.
It will start to download the logs sent by our client and store it in `uploads` folder in the current directory
The logs will be downloaded in compressed format only and will need to be decompressed before working on the analysis part

## client
  The client is present inside the VM, if started without any arguments, it periodically analyses the system behaviour and keeps sending logs to the server

  For configuring this, you'll need to setup `config.ini` in the same directory as the `client.py`
  
  `config.ini.dist` is provided as a template, rename it to `config.ini` and setup the configs

  ```
  [DEFAULT]
  API_URL = <api_url_here>
  LOG_DIR = <directory to store logs>
  EXE_PATH = <path to monitoring exe>
  AUTO_DEL = <delete the logs automatically after sending?> ( yes/no )
  ```

  ### API_URL
  This is the url for the api server ( mostly the analysis engine )

  ### LOG_DIR
  This directory will store the logs which are generated by `monitoring.exe`, the directory should exist
  The logs are generated in a time-stamped manner inside the `LOG_DIR` and will be compressed before sending

  ### EXE_PATH
  The full path to `monitoring.exe` present inside the system

  ### AUTO_DEL
  If you want to delete the logs after they are sent, you can set this flag as `yes`
