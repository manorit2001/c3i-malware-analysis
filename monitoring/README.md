# Monitoring

This module focuses on monitoring the system behaviour and generating dumps

## Dependencies
The dependencies must be installed and added to `PATH` in windows
- [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) ( it is used for apimon )
- [etl2pcapng.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/etl2pcapng) ( it is used for convert etl outputs to pcap )

## Usage
After the dependencies are installed, you can run `monitoring.exe` as administrator. It uses core windows functionalities for extracting essential informations hence requires adminstrative privileges to work properly

It will start monitoring the system behaviour for 15s and then generate the logs. It has various arguments which can be used for tweaking minor things

```
monitoring.exe <logs dir> <program to spawn between analysis>
```

**NOTE: logs_dir must be existing, it will not create it**

## 24x7 monitoring agent
It requires python(>3.6) to be installed in your computer. The setup for agent can be found at [agent](agent/)
